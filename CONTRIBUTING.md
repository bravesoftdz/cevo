Contributing
====

The main purpose of "delphi" branch is maintenance.

The following things will gladly be merged:

* bug-fixing

* manual fixes & improvements

While these things are explicitly not desired:

* Changes that break AI-s

* Changes that break savegames (possibility to open games, both backwards and forwards)

If you want to do some coding larger than bugfixes, and want to help C-evo grow, please consider contributing to "lazarus" branch or write free software AIs.
